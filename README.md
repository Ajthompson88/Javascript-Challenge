## Description

In this project we wrote and deployed a README generator using node js and npm commands. This will be extremely useful going forward as it will save time for any project by allowing us to just answer question to fill in the sections of the readme instead of completely writing an entire file everytime.

## Installation

node.js and npm inquirier
